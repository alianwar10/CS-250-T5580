How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Creating user stories is very important in agile process. Creating user stoies helps us define what client really needs, and how we are going to approach it. User stories are there to help the whole team, from stakeholers to software testers. It helps defines the scope of the project, so once the stories are through, everyone awares of what needs to be done, and everything is documents if any issues arrises in future.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The approach towards any development program is to first understand what program demand. Once the demand is set, then using appropriate tools is another important aspect. Team members needs to know the tools that are being used, and work closely with each other to develpop the product. If a project is in development and someone joins in between then there are knowledge transfer sessions to help them understand the scope of the project and make sure they understand the project and what has been accomplished.
